## 📦 Compiling
First you need to download some requirements such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Java SE 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

I usually use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), therefore it will be the IDE in which we will be compiling with Maven.

Move the extracted Maven folder where you want, then inside the folder there will be a folder called bin, copy the route and add it to the path.

Then open the project folder (TNTReporter), which inside has the `/src` folder and the `pom.xml` file.
In the lower left corner you should see a drop-down menu called "Maven", in that menu our project will appear.

Then you simply have to `Right Click > Run Maven Commands > Install`.

Once the project has been compiled a folder called `/target` should have been created, inside that folder you will find the compiled plugin (tntreporter.jar).
