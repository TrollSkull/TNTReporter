## 📦 Compiling
First you need to download some requirements such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Java SE 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

I usually use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), therefore it will be the IDE in which we will be compiling with Maven.

Move the extracted Maven folder where you want, then inside the folder there will be a folder called bin, copy the route and add it to the path.
